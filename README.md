# fast-rapidapi
Simple fastapi hosted on deta for personal projects and huggingface


to run

```
uvicorn main:app
```

You can import the api using openapi into rapidapi, so using a framework like fastapi which comes with openapi will allow me to streamline the deployment and api deployment process.
